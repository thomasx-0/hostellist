You are a remix developer with an expertise in typescript,
these are instructions on creating this remix app

initial configuration: it must be an SPA, mobile first app

1. I want you to configure the home.tsx, the root.tsx to create the main feature
of the app, I want you to use google auth for clients, then grab hostel listings
from hostel world using this criteria:
- 30 day bookings of the hostel must amount to under 65% of the the user's reported
monthly income
- The hostels must be located in Mexico, Colombia, Brazil, Vietname and Thailand

2. the Hostels should be listed as blocks, with a booking button that takes you to
the booking page for the hostel on hostelworld
